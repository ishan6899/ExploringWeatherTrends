# ExploringWeatherTrends
In this repository I compared how my area's (Delhi) weather is related to Global weather. I found out the relation between the weather trends, similarities and dissimilarities.

## Description
With the help of Global Weather and Delhi's Weather dataset I compared both of their trends and draw some conclusions based on the trends.Due to so much volatility I used moving average's to compare the trends.
